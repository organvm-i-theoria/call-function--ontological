# Interface Directory (Web Stack)

This directory contains files that define the user-facing surface of your project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. These files shape how your project is presented and interacted with.

| File Type | Technical Role | Symbolic Role | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| .html | Web structure | Temple/Portal | Ritual interfaces |
| .css  | Styling (web) | Vestments | Shrine visuals |
| .js   | Frontend logic | Trickster/Magician | Transmutater / Shrine interactivity |
| .php  | Server/CMS | Scribes/Archivists | Forum backend |

Use the template files in this directory (`template.html`, `template.css`, `template.js`, `template.php`) as starting points for new interface modules.
