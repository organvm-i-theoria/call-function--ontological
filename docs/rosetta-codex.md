# Rosetta Stone Codex

A mapping of file types to their technical roles, symbolic metaphors, and use cases across the four layers.

## Language Mapping

| File Type | Technical Role | Symbolic Role | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `.c` | OS kernels, low-level logic | Stone tablets | Core patchbay engine |
| `.cpp` | Game engines, OOP systems | Forge/Craft | Narrative game engine |
| `.css` | Styling (web) | Vestments | Shrine visuals |
| `.go` | Concurrent backend services | Messengers | APIs & sync |
| `.html` | Web structure | Temple/Portal | Ritual interfaces |
| `.java` | Android apps | Duality | Shrine apps (Android) |
| `.js` | Frontend logic | Trickster/Magician | Transmuter / Shrine interactivity |
| `.lua` | Lightweight scripts | Spirit/Breath | Embedded scripts |
| `.m` | Legacy Apple hooks | Ancestor/Roots | Low-level Apple rituals |
| `.php` | Server/CMS | Scribes/Archivists | Forum backend |
| `.py` | AI/ML & scripts | Oracle/Seer | AI & storytelling |
| `.rb` | Dynamic scripting | Alchemist | Generative hubs |
| `.rs` | Secure concurrency | Guardian | Integrity engine |
| `.swift` | iOS apps | Phoenix | Shrine AR apps |

## Meta Pattern

The four layers correspond to elemental aspects of a system:

| Layer | Languages | Metaphor |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Core** | C, C++, Rust, Go | Bones & blood vessels of the OS |
| **Interface** | HTML, CSS, JS, PHP | Skins & portals |
| **Logic** | Python, Lua, Ruby | Breath & spirit |
| **Application** | Swift, Obj-C, Java | Embodiment in the physical hand-held world |

## Symbolic Worldviews

The metaphors can be transposed across different symbolic systems:

| Layer | Organism | Machine | Temple | Cosmos |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Core | Bones | Engine | Foundation | Earth |
| Interface | Skin | Shell | Portal | Air |
| Logic | Breath | Program | Ritual | Fire |
| Application | Body | Vehicle | Shrine | Water |

Choose the worldview that resonates with your project's character.

## Using the Codex

When naming a file, consult the codex to understand:

1. **Technical Role** — What this language typically handles
2. **Symbolic Role** — The archetypal function it serves
3. **Use Case** — Practical application context

Example: A Python file for narrative analysis becomes `logic.agent.narrative.py` because:
- Python's technical role is AI/ML & scripts
- Its symbolic role is Oracle/Seer
- The use case involves storytelling/analysis
- It belongs in the `logic` layer (intelligence, agents)
