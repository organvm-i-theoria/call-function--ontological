PLACEHOLDER: logic.audio.notification.mp3

This is a placeholder for an audio notification file.

In a real project, this would be an MP3 or WAV file containing:
- A short notification sound
- Used by the logic layer for alerting users

The accompanying .meta.json file demonstrates how FUNCTIONcalled()
handles non-code assets with the AudioObject schema type.

To use actual audio:
1. Replace this file with your .mp3 or .wav
2. Rename to: logic.audio.notification.mp3
3. Update the .meta.json encodingFormat accordingly
