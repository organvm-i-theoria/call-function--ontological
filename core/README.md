# Core Directory (Systems Languages)

This directory contains foundational systems code written in languages like C, C++, Rust, and Go. These files form the backbone of your project.

| File Type | Technical Role | Symbolic Role | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| .c   | OS kernels, low-level logic | Stone tablets | Core patchbay engine |
| .cpp | Game engines, OOP systems | Forge/Craft | Narrative game engine |
| .rs  | Safe concurrency & secure systems | Guardian | Integrity engine |
| .go  | Concurrent backend services | Messengers | APIs & sync |

Use the template files (`template.c`, `template.cpp`, `template.rs`, `template.go`) in this directory as starting points for new system-level modules. Each template includes a header comment describing the file type's roles.
